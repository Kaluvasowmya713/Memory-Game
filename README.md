## Important Notes

* Modal HTML and CSS code referenced from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp



## How To Play 
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
* the game starts automatically upon page load. Click the cards to reveal them. The goal is to reveal
cards two at a time to match the pairs. The game ends when all pairs are revealed.
